# 🍔 QuickEats Performance & Customer Insights Dashboard (Tableau)

## Project Context
This project was developed as a Tableau-based analytics case study for QuickEats,
a food delivery platform. The leadership team required a multi-page interactive
report to understand business performance across executive, operations, and
marketing perspectives.

## Dashboard Structure
The Tableau report contains three interactive pages:
1. Executive Summary – High-level KPIs, revenue trends, and customer satisfaction
2. Operations Deep Dive – Delivery efficiency, restaurant performance, and bottlenecks
3. Customer & Cuisine Insights – Satisfaction trends, pricing analysis, and retention risks

## Key Skills Demonstrated
